This guide describes how Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) operators can monitor their deployments. 

##<a id="guide"></a> In This Guide

This guide includes the following topics: 

* <a class="subnav" href="./kpi.html">Key Performance Indicators</a>: A list of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that operators may want to monitor with their PCF deployment to help ensure it is in a good operational state.
* <a class="subnav" href="./key-cap-scaling.html">Key Capacity Scaling Indicators</a>: A list of capacity scaling indicators that operators may want to  monitor to determine when they need to scale their PCF deployments.
* <a class="subnav" href="./metrics.html">Selecting and Configuring a Monitoring System</a>: Guidance for setting up PCF with monitoring platforms to continuously monitor component metrics and trigger health alerts.

For information about logging and metrics in PCF and about monitoring of services for PCF, see <a href="#resources">Additional Resources</a> below.

##<a id="new"></a> KPI Changes from PCF v2.3 to v2.4

This table highlights new and changed KPIs in PCF v2.4.

<table> 
  <tr>
    <td><em>Modified</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>locket.ActiveLocks</code></strong><br><br>
      The Clock Global (Cloud Controller clock) job now also holds a component lock. Therefore the expected number of Active Locks increased to 5. If the Operator disables Zero Downtime App Deployments when configuring PAS, then the expected value will remain 4 for PAS v2.4.

* [Configuring System Logging in PAS](../opsguide/logging-config-opsman.html): 
This topic explains how to configure the PCF Loggregator system to scale its maximum throughput and to forward logs to an external aggregator service.
* [Logging and Metrics](../loggregator/index.html): A guide to Loggregator, the system which aggregates and streams logs and metrics 
from user apps and system components in PAS.
