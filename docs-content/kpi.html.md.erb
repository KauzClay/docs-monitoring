title: Key Performance Indicators 
owner: PCF Metrics Platform Monitoring
---

This topic describes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that operators may want to monitor with their Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment to help ensure it is in a good operational state.

The following PCF v1.10 KPIs are provided for operators to give general guidance on monitoring a PCF deployment using platform component and system (BOSH) metrics. 
Although many metrics are emitted from the platform, the following PCF v1.10 KPIs are 
high-signal-value metrics that can indicate emerging platform issues. 

This alerting and response guidance has been shown to apply to most deployments. 
Pivotal recommends that operators continue to fine-tune the alert measures to their deployment 
by observing historical trends. 
Pivotal also recommends that operators expand beyond this guidance and create new, deployment-specific monitoring
metrics, thresholds, and alerts based on learning from their deployments.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Thresholds noted as "dynamic" in the tables below indicate that while a metric is highly important to watch, the relative numbers at which to set threshold warnings are specific to a given PCF environment and its use cases. You should occasionally review these dynamic thresholds because the PCF foundation and its usage continue to evolve. See <a href="metrics.html#thresholds">Determine Warning and Critical Thresholds</a> for more information.</p>

      <td>Remaining amount of memory in MiB available for this Diego cell to allocate to containers.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Use</strong>: Indicates the available cell memory. Insufficient cell memory can prevent pushing and scaling apps.
          <br><br>
          The strongest operational value of this metric is to understand a deployment's average app size and to monitor or alert on ensuring that at least some cells have large enough capacity to accept standard app size pushes. For example, if pushing a 4&nbsp;GB app, Diego would have trouble placing that app if there is no one cell with sufficient capacity of 4&nbsp;GB or greater.
	  <br><br>
	      As an example, Pivotal Cloud Ops uses a standard of 4&nbsp;GB, and computes and monitors for the number of cells with at least 4&nbsp;GB free. When the number of cells with at least 4&nbsp;GB falls below a defined threshold, this is a scaling indicator alert to increase  capacity. This <em>free chunk</em> count threshold should be tuned to the deployment size and the standard size of apps being pushed to the deployment.<br><br>

            <li>Determine the size of a standard app in your deployment. This is the suggested value to calculate <em>free chunks</em> of Remaining Memory by.
	      <li>Create a script or tool that can iterate through each Diego Cell and do the following: 
          <ol>
          <li>Pull the <code>rep.CapacityRemainingMemory</code> metric for each cell.</li>
          <li>Divide the values received by 1000 to get the value in Gigabytes (if desired threshold is GB-based).</li>
          <li>Compare recorded values to your minimum capacity threshold, and count the number of cells that have equal or greater than the desired amount of <em>free chunk</em> space.</li>    
	       </ol>
	 <li> Determine a desired scaling threshold based on the minimum amount of <em>free chunks</em> that are acceptable in this deployment given historical trends.</li>
	 <li> Set an alert to indicate the need to scale cell memory capacity when the value falls below the desired threshold number.</li>
	      </ol> 
	<b>For visualization purposes</b>:<br>
	      Looking at this metric (<code>rep.CapacityRemainingMemory</code>) as a minimum value per cell has more informational value than alerting value. It can be an interesting heatmap visualization, showing average variance and density over time.

Unusually high spikes, if not known to be associated with an expected increase in demand, could indicate a DDoS risk. For performance and capacity management, consider this metric a measure of router throughput per job, converting it to requests-per-second, by looking at the delta value of <code>gorouter.total_requests</code> and deriving back to 1s, or <code>gorouter.total_requests.delta)/5</code> (per gorouter instance). This helps you see trends in the throughput rate that indicate a need to scale the Gorouter instances. Use the trends you observe to tune the threshold alerts for this metric.

			If visualizing these metrics on a dashboard, <code>gorouter.total_routes</code> can be helpful by visualizing dramatic drops. However, for alerting purposes, the metric <code>gorouter.ms_since_last_registry_update</code> is more valuable for quicker identification of GoRouter issues. Alerting thresholds for <code>gorouter.total_routes</code> should focus on dramatic increases or decreases out of expected range.

                    In PCF v1.10, Pivotal recommends combining both of these metrics to present a full picture of dropped messages.
                    However, the metric <code>DopplerServer.TruncatingBuffer.totalDroppedMessages</code> is 
                    being transitioned to <code>DopplerServer.doppler.shedEnvelopes</code>.  
                    In PCF v1.10, truncating buffer usage is approximately 5% of all possible traffic, primarily syslog drains.

                    <strong>Use</strong>: This metric is an important indicator of consistent logging. Set an alert to indicate if there is too much traffic coming in to the Dopplers 
                     or if the Firehose consumers are not keeping pace. 
                     Both issues result in dropped messages.
